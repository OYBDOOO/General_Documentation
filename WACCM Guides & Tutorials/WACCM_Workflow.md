## If you have not used WACCM before, create a directory to contain your cases e.g.

```mkdir /nobackup/[username]/cesm2/```

```mkdir /nobackup/[username]/cesm2/cases/```

If you do not already have a user directory in /nobackup/ you'll need to make one using

```mkdir /nobackup/[username]```


## Create a new case
- Navigate to the folder you created to store your cases in /nobackup/

```cd /nobackup/[username]/cesm2/cases/```

- Create a new case using the `create_newcase` command from the relevant model folder. If you've not ported the model yourself you will need to be granted the correct permissions to use this 
(currently working versions are either ported by Wuhu Feng or CEMAC. This document is correct for Wuhu's ported version).
Note you will also need permissions to the input data folder, and if using WACCM-X compsets, you will need access to the ESMF libraries. 

```/home/home01/earfw/release_cesm2_1_3/cime/scripts/create_newcase --case /nobackup/$USER/cesm2/cases/[choose a descriptive name e.g. modelversion_compset_resolution --compset [compset_name] --res [resolution_name] --machine arc4```

e.g. ```/home/home01/earfw/release_cesm2_1_3/cime/scripts/create_newcase --case /nobackup/$USER/cesm2/cases/CESM213_FX2000_f19_f19_mg16_arc4 --compset FX2000 --res f19_f19_mg16 --machine arc4 --run-unsupported```



N.B. Depending on the combination of compset, resolution etc you may need to add `--run-unsupported` but the terminal output will notify you of this if so

**Compsets**
`--compset` is the argument that specifies the component set. The compset specifies the component models and if they are active or not, forcing scenarios, and physics options for the models. 

Available Compsets are listed here: https://docs.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/config/compsets.html

**Resolution**
Compsets determine which grid is required.

Link for CESM Supported Grids: http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/config/grids.html


After running create_newcase, a $CASEROOT directory is created that contains the model script needed to build and run the case

Once you've created a new case, use `cd` to navigate to the new case directory

`cd /nobackup/$USER/cesm2/cases/[case_name]`


## Change the number of cores

Before calling ./case.setup, changes to NTASKS, NTHRDS, ROOTPE, PSTRID and NINST must be made, as well as any changes to the env_mach_specific.xml file, which contains some configuration for the module environment and environment variables. I think NTASKS is the ony option in env_build I've ever changed.

**Note**, it is always best to change NTASKS using ./xmlchange rather than manually editing the files, since using this method will change NTASKS for all linked components ('CPL:80', 'ATM:80', 'LND:80', 'ICE:80', 'OCN:80', 'ROF:80', 'GLC:80', 'WAV:80') whereas it's easy to forget if doing this manually.

- 80 cores are used as default (2 nodes), but you can change this to 40 if you wanted (e.g. if you can see only 40 cores are free in the job queue and you want your job to be run faster)
```./xmlchange NTASKS=40```

## Set up the case

```./case.setup```

This will create various scripts (e.g. case.run, case.st_archive), directories (e.g. the /run/ directory), and files (e.g. user_nl_cam file (where you can customise component namelist files and set parameters for model output) 

## SourceMods

If you want to make modifications to the CESM code, the best practise is to copy the relevant sub-routine into the SourceMods directory in your case directory.

For example, if you wanted to modify a CAM subroutine, you would copy that subroutine to the following location `/nobackup/$USER/cesm2/cases/[case_name]/SourceMods/src.cam/`

These are any 

- You can copy files from the source code (e.g. at /home/home01/earfw/release_cesm2_1_3/components/cam/src/) and edit them in the sourcemods folder if you want to adjust any processes, rates etc. Do **NOT** edit files directly in the model folder there.

- You will need files for the MIF in this folder, any changes to the chemistry, physics etc

##  Modifying .xml files

Now, you will want to make any changes to the .xml files env_build.xml and env_run.xml. 

When modifying an *.xml file, you can use the xmlchange tool. This is done using the syntax `./xmlchange VARIABLE=VALUE` in your case directory. If you want to change multiple variables at a time then itâ€™s `./xmlchange KEY1=value1,KEY2=value2,KEY3=value3`

The xml files can also be edited manually with your chosen text editor, but you should take care not to introduce any typos and this method can get complicated if there are lots of dependencies. 
Using a text editor to take a look in the xml files, you can see descriptions of each variable (including permitted values), which can be  helpful in understanding what they control.

If you're not sure the name of a xml variable, you can search using `./xmlquery -p [XXXX]` where XXXX can be a variable name or part of one e.g. 
```
$./xmlquery -p TASK

  Results in group mach_pes
          NTASKS: ['CPL:40', 'ATM:40', 'LND:40', 'ICE:40', 'OCN:40', 'ROF:40', 'GLC:40', 'WAV:40', 'ESP:40']
          NTASKS_PER_INST: ['ATM:80', 'LND:80', 'ICE:80', 'OCN:80', 'ROF:80', 'GLC:80', 'WAV:80', 'ESP:1']
  
  Results in group mach_pes_last
          MAX_MPITASKS_PER_NODE: 40
          MAX_TASKS_PER_NODE: 40
  
  Results in group run_pio
          PIO_NUMTASKS: ['CPL:-99', 'ATM:-99', 'LND:-99', 'ICE:-99', 'OCN:-99', 'ROF:-99', 'GLC:-99', 'WAV:-99', 'ESP:-99']

$ ./xmlquery -p TIME

  Results in group case.run
          JOB_WALLCLOCK_TIME: 48:00:00
          USER_REQUESTED_WALLTIME:
  
  Results in group case.st_archive
          JOB_WALLCLOCK_TIME: 0:20:00
          USER_REQUESTED_WALLTIME:
  
  Results in group run_flags
          TIMER_DETAIL: 2
          TIMER_LEVEL: 4

```

### env_build.xml 

You will want to add an initialisation file to the CAM_CONFIG_OPTS e.g. `<entry id="CAM_CONFIG_OPTS" value="-phys cam4 -waccmx -ionosphere wxie -chem waccm_ma -usr_mech_infile /nobackup/earfw/acp-21-15619-2021/acp-21-15619-2021.in">`

I think this is the only thing I've ever changed in here though

### env_run.xml
There are various variables to change in env_run. 

When a CESM model run is first initialized, it is called an initial run. If an initial run has finished and you want to continue to run the case, you can change the variable $CONTINUE_RUN and submit the run again.
For an intial run, $CONTINUE_RUN must be set to FALSE. If the model continues a run, $CONTINUE_RUN is set to TRUE.


An initial CESM run can be initialized in one of three run types: startup, branch,or hybrid. The $RUN_TYPE variable is set to startup, hybrid, or branch accordingly (see section below). 
Note that the $RUN_TYPE setting is only important for the initial run of a production run when the $CONTINUE_RUN variable is set to FALSE. 


$STOP_N and $STOP_OPTION control the length of the run per job submission. 

$STOP_OPTION : sets the run length time interval type, i.e. nmonths, ndays, nyears.
$STOP_N : sets the number of intervals (set by STOP_OPTION) to run the model during each submission within the specified wallclock time.

e.g.

```./xmlchange STOP_N=6```
```./xmlchange STOP_OPTION='nmonths'```


Restart files are written by each model component at intervals dictated $REST_OPTION and $REST_N. 
If a run encounters problems and crashes, restart files function as a back up point - you can continue the run from the latest restart point.
Restart files allow the model to stop and then start again with bit-for-bit exact capability (i.e. the model output is exactly the same as if it had never been stopped). 
The default values for these two variables are set to be the same as $STOP_OPTION and $STOP_N. 
In most cases, you don't need to change these variables, but it can be useful if you want to be able to start the model again from a particular point, or if you want restart files more often than you are running the model for at each submission.

$REST_OPTION -  sets frequency of model restart writes (same options as STOP_OPTION)
$STOP_N -  sets the number of intervals (set by REST_OPTION)

Note, Whenever a component writes a restart file, it also writes a restart pointer file of the form, rpointer.$component (i.e. rpointer.atm). 
The restart pointer file contains the restart filename that was just written by the component. 
Upon a restart, each component reads its restart pointer file to determine the filename(s) to read in order to continue the model run. 


### Run Types

#### STARTUP
In a startup run (the default), all model components are initialized from the basic default initial conditions. The coupler does not need an initial file.



#### BRANCH
In a branch run, all components are initialized using a set of restart files from a previous run (determined by the $RUN_REFCASE and $RUN_REFDATE variables in env_run.xml). 
Branch runs are typically used when sensitivity or parameter studies are required, or when settings for history file output streams need to be modified while still maintaining bit-for-bit reproducibility.

$RUN_REFCASE is the name of the case you're branching from. 
$RUN_REFDATE is the date of th restart files, the start of your new branch run.

In a branch run, setting $RUN_STARTDATE is ignored because the model components obtain the start date from their restart datasets. Therefore, the start date cannot be changed for a branch run. 
This is the same mechanism that is used for performing a restart run (where $CONTINUE_RUN is set to TRUE in the env_run.xml file).



#### HYBRID
In a hybrid run, CESM is initialized more like a startup, but uses initialization datasets from a previous case. This is somewhat analogous to a branch run with relaxed restart constraints.

I'm not very familiar with hybrid runs but there is more info in the Online tutorial here:
https://ncar.github.io/CESM-Tutorial/notebooks/modifications/xml/modify_run_type/hybrid_branch_restart.html


### user_nl_cam file

This file results in the creation of component namelists, the *_in files (i.e. atm_in, lnd_in, and so on). The *_in files are located in $CASEROOT/CaseDocs/ and in $RUNDIR.

Documentation is available on the CESM webpage: https://docs.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/settings/current/cam_nml.html

Edit the user_nl_cam file in your chosen text editor. The *_in files should not be directly edited. Any manual changes of the *_in files will be overwritten when you compile or submit the run.

Note that you cannot change the namelist variables after the run is submitted or when CONTINUE_RUN=TRUE.

avgflag_pertape, fincl1, fincl2, fincl13 etc, mfilt, and nhtfrq together control the ouput data contents/frequency.

- **avgflag_pertape** sets the averaging flag for all variables on a particular history file series. Valid values are:
    - A ==> Average,
    - B ==> GMT 00:00:00 average
    - I ==> Instantaneous
    - M ==> Minimum
    - X ==> Maximum
    - L ==> Local-time
    - S ==> Standard deviation
- **fincl1,2,3**, etc contain list of fields to include on the first/second/third history file (by default the name of fincl1 contains the string "h0", fincl2 is "h1" etc)

- **mfilt** specifies the maximum number of time samples that are written to each history file. 

- **nhtfrq** controls the write frequencies - if nhtfrq(1) = 0, the file will be a monthly average (Note only the first file series may be a monthly average).
    - If nhtfrq(i) > 0, frequency is specified as number of timesteps
    - If nhtfrq(i) < 0, frequency is specified as number of hours
 
  e.g.
```
&cam_history_nl
 avgflag_pertape                = 'A', 'I', 'A'
  fincl1 = 'Fep','Mgp','Nap','Fe','Na','Mg','e','T','Z3','U','V','OMEGA'
  fincl2 = 'Fep','Mgp','Nap','Fe','Na','Mg','e','T','Z3','U','V','OMEGA'
  fincl3 = 'Fep','Mgp','Nap','Fe','Na','Mg','e','T','Z3','U','V','OMEGA'
  fincl4 =' '
  fincl5 =' '
  fincl6 =' '
  fincl7 =' '
 mfilt          =              1,  24, 8 
 nhtfrq         =             0,   -1,  6
/
```
fincl1 (h0) is a monthly average
fincl2 (h1) is hourly instantaneous with 24x hourly outputs per file
fincl3 (h2) is 3hourly average (specified in timesteps rather than hours. Standard WACCM time step is 30 minutes). Output is 8x 3hrly outputs per file (spanning one 24h period)

You can generate the namelists by running `./preview_namelists`. Note that this step is optional as the script preview_namelists is also called when you build the model.
